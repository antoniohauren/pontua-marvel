# Tech stack

- pnpm
- vite
- react
- typescript
- tailwindcss
- storybook
- zod
- react-hook-form
- react-query

---

Tailwind for fast css write. storybook for component preview without the necessity of import it on an actual page. react with typescript for a typesafe magic, alongside with zod and hook-form for even more typesafety and not only on dev, typesafe for forms on production as well. react-query for efficiently api calls.

# Commands

### pnpm can be replaced with yarn or even npm

```
pnpm dev
```

For build:

```
pnpm build
```
